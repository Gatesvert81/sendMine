This is a Next..jsProject.
I made this website to help myself and my collegues to send files to pfinting presses without connecting our whatsapp to thier pc and avoid people viewing our private messages.

## Project Info
I made the front-end with next.js and Tailwindcss. Just basic html, react stuffs with no animations.
I used Firebase as my backend, from authenticating users to storing files.
